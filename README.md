# React Native Todo App (using React Hooks)

A [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) Todo App, which uses [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to manage and persist state via `createContext`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`, and `useState`. Also uses [React Native Elements](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/).
